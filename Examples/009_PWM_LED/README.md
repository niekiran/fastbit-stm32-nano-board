**009_PWM_LED**

This program generates an LED pattern using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) on a microcontroller. PWM is utilized to control the brightness of LEDs in a sequential pattern.

**Overview**

The program utilizes Timer hardware on the microcontroller to generate PWM signals. Three LEDs are connected to different output channels of the Timer. The PWM duty cycle is varied to adjust the brightness of each LED.

**Functionality:**

The program utilizes Timer hardware on the microcontroller to generate PWM signals. Three LEDs are connected to different output channels of the Timer. The PWM duty cycle is varied to adjust the brightness of each LED.

**LED Pattern Generation**

The LED pattern is generated sequentially:

- LED 1 (Blue) turns on gradually, then fades out.
- LED 2 (Red) turns on gradually, then fades out.
- LED 3 (Green) turns on gradually, then fades out.

This sequential pattern repeats continuously.
