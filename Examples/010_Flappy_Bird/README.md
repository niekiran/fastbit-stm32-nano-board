**010_Flappy_Bird**

The project is an implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game on a microcontroller platform using STM32CubeIDE. It involves controlling a bird sprite to navigate through obstacles displayed on an LCD screen.

**Gameplay**

1. Start the game: Press the user button to start the game.
2. Control the bird: Tilt the microcontroller to control the bird's flight. Tilting the device upwards makes the bird flap its wings and ascend, while tilting downwards allows it to descend.
3. Navigate through obstacles: Guide the bird through the gaps between the obstacles by tilting the microcontroller carefully.
4. Scoring: Each successful passage through a gap increases the score by 1.
5. Game over: If the bird collides with an obstacle or the ground, the game ends. Press the user button to restart the game.

Note: We have utilized the GC4901A LCD TFT display for the Flappy Bird microcontroller game.
