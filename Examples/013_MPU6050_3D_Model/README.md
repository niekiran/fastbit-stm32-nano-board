**013\_MPU6050\_3D\_Model**

This project demonstrates how to visualize MPU6050 sensor data in a 3D model using the Processing IDE. The MPU6050 sensor captures motion data, which is then transmitted over UART to a computer. The Processing script reads this data and renders a 3D model that represents the motion of the sensor.

**Processing Visualization**

1. **Install Processing**: Download and install the Processing IDE from [Processing.org](https://processing.org/download).
2. **Open Script**: Open the MPU6050\_3D\_model.pde script located in the processing/ directory.
3. **Adjust COM Port**: Update the COM port in the Processing script to match your setup.
