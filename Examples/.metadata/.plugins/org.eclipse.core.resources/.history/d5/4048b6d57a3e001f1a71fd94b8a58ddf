**007_MPU6050_Angle_Read**

This embedded system program utilizes the MPU6050 sensor to monitor the orientation data of an embedded system. It reads sensor data from the MPU6050 and controls LEDs based on the sensor readings.

**Overview:**

The program reads the pitch (y-axis) and roll (x-axis) orientation data from the MPU6050 sensor and uses this information to control LEDs accordingly.

**Functionality:**

**LED Control:**

- The program monitors the pitch (y-axis) and roll (x-axis) orientation data from the MPU6050 sensor.
- If the pitch value is positive (indicating a forward tilt), LED 2 (green) turns on.
- If the pitch value is negative (indicating a backward tilt), LED 3 (blue) turns on.
- If the roll value is non-zero (indicating a tilt to the left or right), LED 1 (red) turns on.
