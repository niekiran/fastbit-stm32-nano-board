**008_SPI_Loopback**

This embedded system program demonstrates SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) loopback data transmission on an embedded system.

**Overview:**

The program establishes a loopback connection, allowing the microcontroller to transmit and receive data internally using the SPI protocol.

**Functionality:**

##Data Transmission:
  - A predefined transmit buffer is initialized with data.
  - The program transmits the data over SPI and simultaneously receives it through the loopback connection. received data, can be viewed through the SWV terminal.
